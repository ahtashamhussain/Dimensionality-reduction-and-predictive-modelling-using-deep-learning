# Dimensionality-reduction-and-predictive-modelling-using-deep-learning
I had a dataset with very limited data samples and lot of input features. 
Firstly, I justed cleaned the dataset.
Secondly I normalized the data.
Thirdly, I eliminated features that have very low variance, highly correlated and find out feature importance as well. 
Finally used deep learning with linear regression to get good values of r-squared value.
